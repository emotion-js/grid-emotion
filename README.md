> Responsive React grid system built with emotion

grid-emotion is a wrapper around [grid-styled](https://github.com/jxnblk/grid-styled) that uses [emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) instead of [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components).

All of the components in grid-emotion are explained in [grid-styled's README](https://github.com/jxnblk/grid-styled#readme) and [its site](http://jxnblk.com/grid-styled/).

## Thanks

Thanks to [Brent Jackson](https://github.com/jxnblk) who built grid-styled. ❤️
